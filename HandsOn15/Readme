Implementations of three classic graph algorithms in Python:

Dijkstra's Algorithm - for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

Bellman-Ford Algorithm - for computing shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph, capable of handling graphs with negative weight edges.

Floyd-Warshall Algorithm - for finding shortest paths between every pair of vertices in a given edge weighted directed graph.
