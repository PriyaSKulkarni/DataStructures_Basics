CSE-5311-006-Design and Analysis of Agorithms

Implemented:

1. insertion sort

2. selection sort

3. bubble sort

4. Argument on selection sort correctness.

3. Benchmarked the runtime of each algorithm. included information about computer (ram, cpu etc.) and run with various input sizes; from small (array of size 5,10,20) all the way up to large arrays (where your computer is struggling).  ploted a graph of time vs input size n.
