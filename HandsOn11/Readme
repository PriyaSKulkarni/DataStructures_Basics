Basic Binary Search Tree: This was a simple implementation that allowed for unbalanced trees. It included operations such as insertion and searching for integer values.

Red-Black Tree: This implementation involved balancing the tree to ensure logarithmic height. It included operations like insertion, deletion, and searching for integer values.

AVL Tree: Similar to the Red-Black Tree, this implementation aimed at maintaining balanced trees by performing rotations as necessary. It supported operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching for integer values.

Tests were conducted to validate the correctness of these implementations, ensuring they functioned as expected with various input scenarios.
